# Naming of new things

It might be that your idea is simply not as interesting as you thought. That happens. It might also be that you poorly explained it for a casual visitor.

We tend to discuss things that are easy to talk about.
Universal shared experiences are easy to talk about. tech interviews, industry gossip, macro trends and design opinions. We have a shared vocabulary for all of those things.

We are also constantly pattern-matching. If some pattern triggers an emotional response (whether relevant or irrelevant to the presented idea), we’ll likely base the first impression on it. Learning by association is a tremendously valuable mental shortcut. 
If your idea really is new, there might be no shared vocabulary to discuss it yet.
It’s the elephant in the room. And we can’t discuss what we never named.
How do you give a name to a problem?
The same way humans always did.
By telling a story.
Name it, and they will come.
