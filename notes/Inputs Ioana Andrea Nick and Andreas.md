# Inputs Ioana Andrea Nick and Andreas

inputs andrea and ioana Design

netflix -> abstract

# ioana inputs: 
dont bother about prototyping i  erarly design stages, use time for design!
formula to calculate row length accoreding to letter size 
show more visual elements, use scrolling for visual story telling like 
Break down in formation and show them in nice ways
add more images
show transitions in design not statically but perhaps in the transition itself and then end step therefore showing interactivity

# inputs andrea:
### farben auf meta ebene suchen
BEISPIEL: -> fixie -> modern -> provokativ -> farben und kontraste modern und provokativ
mit farben und flächen spielen! nicht nur bilder!
stroke width of svg needs top be consistent with border widths and borders! 
### Best case: even matching typo widths
print infos, highlight -> main infos -> only think about visualizing this dataset not stuff around
IOANA pro tipps:
### never flip images with people in them!!!!
people's faces are not symmetrical

### this is considered ugly try to break it

yea it's a bit too much text - and more than that : too many font sizes. 
### a classic rule says aim for no more than 3 sizes... 
### also the differences between sizes should be very clear. if you kinda wonder what is smaller and what bigger it looks like it's a mistake.


# Andreas

Animation should be used for loading transitions, when data needs to be loaded slow animations suck https://cher-ami.tv/en also uses way too much bandwidth and stuff

# Nick: 

need a svg logo? rip it from a media handed out pdf with illustrator ✨
