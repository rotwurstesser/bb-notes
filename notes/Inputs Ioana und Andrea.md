### this is considered ugly try to break it

yea it's a bit too much text - and more than that : too many font sizes. 
### a classic rule says aim for no more than 3 sizes... 
### also the differences between sizes should be very clear. if you kinda wonder what is smaller and what bigger it looks like it's a mistake.
