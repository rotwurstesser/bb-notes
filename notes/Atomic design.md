# Atomic design

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2019-09-12-14-39-45.png)



- Atoms: This screen of Instagram’s UI consists of a handful of icons, some text-level elements, and two image types: the primary image and the user’s avatar image.
- Molecules: Several icons form simple utilitarian components like the bottom navigation bar and the photo actions bar where users can like or comment on a photo. Also, simple combinations of text and/or images form relatively simple components.
- Organisms: Here we can see the photo organism take shape, which consists of the user’s information, time stamp, the photo itself, actions around that photo, and information about the photo including like count and caption. This organism becomes the cornerstone of the entire Instagram experience as it is stacked repeatedly in a never-ending stream of user-generated photos.
- Templates: We get to see our components come together in the context of a layout. Also, it’s here where we see the exposed content skeleton of the Instagram experience, highlighting dynamic content such as the user’s handle, avatar, photo, like count, and caption.
Pages: And finally we see the final product, complete with real content poured into it, which helps ensure the underlying design system comes together to form a beautiful and functional UI.
