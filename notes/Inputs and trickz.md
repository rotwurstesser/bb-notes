# Inputs and trickz

Start designing a feature first instead of a full design, make the design then around that

For example, say you’re building a flight booking service. You could start with a feature like “searching for a flight”.
Your interface will need:
• A field for the departure city
• A field for the destination city
• A field for the departure date
• A field for the return date
• A button to perform the search

before you go wild on all the options preset some and hold yourselfs to these!

a nice trick by nick is to just pick some random nice feeling shades from a image and delete the ones that dont fit (design by elimination)

The more systems you have in place, the faster you’ll be able to work and the less you’ll second guess your own decisions.
You’ll want systems for things like:
• Font size
• Font weight
• Line height
• Color
• Margin
• Padding
• Width
• Height
• Box shadows



inputs of friends in design 💕

netflix -> abstract

# nick inputs: 

design need to do stuff, what does it need to do? what basics of information do we need? what are the needs? so first we write a story, try and ask: what is your problem? what did you try? and how did this work or not work?
## Need (story): 
"me and a friend have a house, we want to pay with our seperate accounts, so we need to proof we bought stuff and we need a system to share the money fairly, we already tried an excel and we tried a manual thing with papers but this is so much work"
## Then we pick out the keypoints/painpoints:
- seperate entries
- trackable who owes stuff
- manual entering sucks
## now we know what the problems are and we try and design solutions tailored to this:
- accounts allow seperation, the lists display the stuff and show a total, it fixes need and paipoint XY
- allow Z to fix 


## we can use personas to map this on:

## we can also use a product vision board for this:

## this helps us tailor solutions for this problem

# ioana inputs: 
dont bother about prototyping i  erarly design stages, use time for design!
formula to calculate row length accoreding to letter size 
show more visual elements, use scrolling for visual story telling like 
Break down in formation and show them in nice ways
add more images
show transitions in design not statically but perhaps in the transition itself and then end step therefore showing interactivity

# inputs andrea:
### farben auf meta ebene suchen
BEISPIEL: -> fixie -> modern -> provokativ -> farben und kontraste modern und provokativ
mit farben und flächen spielen! nicht nur bilder!
stroke width of svg needs top be consistent with border widths and borders! 
### Best case: even matching typo widths
print infos, highlight -> main infos -> only think about visualizing this dataset not stuff around
IOANA pro tipps:
### never flip images with people in them!!!!
people's faces are not symmetrical

now the title - you see it makes a little triangle?

### this is considered ugly try to break it

yea it's a bit too much text - and more than that : too many font sizes. 
### a classic rule says aim for no more than 3 sizes... 
### also the differences between sizes should be very clear. if you kinda wonder what is smaller and what bigger it looks like it's a mistake.


# Andreas

Animation should be used for loading transitions, when data needs to be loaded slow animations suck https://cher-ami.tv/en also uses way too much bandwidth and stuff

# Nick: 

need a svg logo? rip it from a media handed out pdf with illustrator ✨
